# Cognitive-Warmup

This app will produce a "cognitive warmup" according to a cron schedule, likely once every day. Generated content will consist of various questions, possibly including fermi questions, soft-skill probing questions, interview-like questions, questions about documents uploaded to source folder. It will also include some related content to consume, likely scraped from the html sources included in this list, and related to personal documents uploaded.

In the near future, I plan to involve OpenAI's Realtime API for interaction smoothness.
